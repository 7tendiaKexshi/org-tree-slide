	* org-tree-slide.el (tree-slide-slide-in): Add slide-in visual effect
	If you don't like this effect, use (setq tree-slide-slide-in-effect nil).
	You can also control the distance of moving slide-in trees, use
	`tree-slide-slide-in-brank-lines'.

	* org-tree-slide.el (tree-slide-slide-in-waiting):
	Add a variable to control slide-in duration.
	If you feel the slide-in speed so fast, then set this value bigger like

	* org-tree-slide.el (tree-slide-play): Add timer to count down presentation
	By default, timer will NOT be activated. If you use a count down timer,
	please use prefix (C-u) when starting up slide view. Which means
	`C-u C-x sp ' is the right command.

	* org-tree-slide.el: Add play and stop function, and show slide header
	To play the slide, type `C-x s p'.
	To stop the slide, type `C-x s s'.

	* org-tree-slide.el: Add a function to change mode-line during presentation
